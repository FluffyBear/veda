Project Skeleton for the veda system.

You should find in this directory:

README : this file
Makefile : simple make commands
rebar : the Rebar build tool for Erlang applications
rebar.config : configuration for Rebar

You probably want to do one of a couple of things at this point:

0. Build the veda system:
   $ make
   - or -
   $ ./rebar compile

1. Start up the skeleton application:
   $ make webstart

2. Change the basic application:
   edit app/*/src/veda@*.erl
